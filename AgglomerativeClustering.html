        Different agglomerative (hierarchical) clustering algorithms were proposed to compute phylogenetic trees
        from evolutionary distances:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (average linkage) by <br />
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_33927_astatisticalmethodforevaluatin1902">Robert R. Sokal and Charles D. Michener (1958)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (simple average) by
                <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001316446602600201">Louis L. McQuitty (1967)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Neighbour-Joining (single linkage) by
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040454">Naruya Saitou and Masatoshi Nei (1987)</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        And there exists many approaches and all of them have advantages and disadvantages.
        For example Unweighted PGMA (or Weighted PGMA) is only then a good tree computation method,
        if the distances from the root to the leafs are always the same (ultrametric distance matrix).
        In other cases the approach is unreliable.
        Where from Neighbour-Joining is said that it is generally the better procedure
        (giving better results).

        <br />
        <br />

        The principle of all agglomerative (bottom-up) approaches is always the same,
        in the beginning you have given a matrix of pairwise evolutionary distances
        between singleton clusters (containing only one element)
        and in this matrix you search for the entry with the lowest value $d_{min} = d_{i,j}$
        (where $i \neq j$). You merge the clusters $i$ and $j$ to a new cluster $ij = i \cup j$
        and recompute the distances to the remaining clusters with some distance formula $dist$
        given with the respective approach.
        Afterwards the distance between $i,j$ and the merged cluster $ij$
        in the tree is recomputed with another formula.
        These stated steps are iterated for $O(N)$ rounds,
        where $N$ is number of input singleton clusters.

        <br />
        <br />

        For the given input, the
        <ul>
            <li>changing distance matrices</li>
            <li>phylogenetic tree</li>
        </ul>
        are computed and displayed.
